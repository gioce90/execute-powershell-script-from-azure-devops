# execute-powershell-script-from-azure-devops
Sometimes happens that you have Powershell scripts shared with your work team on an Azure DevOps repository. Scripts that can be updated frequently. It can be useful to run the latest updated version, without constantly checking and downloading. With this script you configure it once and you'll be able to run the latest version forever. Simple :)
